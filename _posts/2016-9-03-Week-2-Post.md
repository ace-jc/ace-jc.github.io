**What did you do this past week?**

This past week I spent some time becoming more familiar with Python. I was surprised how quickly the algorithm came to me given my previous collatz experience in C++. It really does seem like explicit memory management is kind of a hassle when you want to just get the algorithm working. Although comparing my sphere run time in python vs c++ shows c++ is about five times faster!  

**What's in your way?**

At this point I'm feeling pretty confident about python and docker. I think the next obstacle might be javascript. I've been doing the readings and the author seems to suggest that javascript has many design flaws. It is quite incredible that javascript is very heavily critized for its design, yet it remains one of the most (if not the most) popular languages in the world. 

**What will you do next week?**

Next week I'll ensure the collatz project is completed given the spec. During Wednesday and Thursday the Engineering Expo is happening and since it is my last semester at UT, I'll be sure to attend. Given the size of the Expo and a busy schedule I'll have to figure out the best time to go while possibly missing some classes.

So far I'm enjoying Professor Downing's class. This week was also very reminiscent of the OOP course, given that we discussed the details of the Collatz Conjecture and some strategy for efficiently solving for values between zero and one million. Given all of the Collatz discussion I did some additional readings online and found that Gerhard Opfer actually solved it! Link to his paper [here](http://preprint.math.uni-hamburg.de/public/papers/hbam/hbam2011-09.pdf). Unfortunately, he had this added to his publication only a short time after...

"The reasoning on p. 11, that “The set of all vertices (2n, l) in all levels will
contain all even numbers 2n ≥ 6 exactly once.” has turned out to be incomplete.
Thus, the statement “that the Collatz conjecture is true” has to be withdrawn,
at least temporarily."

Which brings the following xkcd to mind...

**Tip of the week:**
I found an interesting [neural network visualization tool](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/fc/). When you write a number on the square in the upper left hand side it gives you the best guess of the that number. The unique thing about this site is the visualization of the entire neuron graph!
