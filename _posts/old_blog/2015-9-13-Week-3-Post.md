title: Week 3 Post

This is my third blog post discussing Professor Glenn Downing's Object Oriented Programming class. As the fall session moves toward the later weeks of September, the career fair moves into full swing and companies are all over campus in their attempt to recruit student talent. Professor Downing's class was no exception as we had Bloomberg's Chris Martin in our classroom discussing his organization. One interesting aspect of Chris Martin's point of view is that he was not only a Texas Longhorn, but was also a graduate of UTCS and actually took Professor Downing's course only a few years ago. 

Chris's talk was rather interesting as he discussed the technologies used by Bloomberg and some of the ways his personal relationship with the technologies changed over time. One example of this was his feeling toward java only a few years ago. He mentioned that java felt perfect to him with no necessary need for change whatsoever. As time passed and java evolved, he learn of lambda expressions in java 8 (among other things) and now uses them quite frequently. I think his main point was that technologies will evolve no matter how much we like them, part of "the job" is learning to enjoy picking up these new technologies. 

Another reason I found Chris's talk to be rather interesting was due to an interview I had seen just the previous weekend. In [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB_dXqAMUtE) (circa 1998) Michael Bloomberg was describing his business and how it came about. For those interested he was "fired" from Salomon Brothers as they were bought by another company back in 1981. With his severance he decided to start the company that ultimately became Bloomberg LP. Michael Bloomberg also explains in the interview that although many people know of Bloomberg news, website or radio, the primary business is actually the Bloomberg terminal. I had heard of the terminal many times before, but never actually saw a live demo until the talk in Professor Downing's class. For those who have never heard of a Bloomberg terminal, it is essentially a market/news query and information system. It incorporates lots of data from many different industries and presents the information clearly to its subscribers. Another interesting note is that the terminal service fee can run from $20,000 to $24,000 per year per Bloomberg terminal. Despite the high cost, Bloomberg has 315,000 subscribers worldwide!


Tip of the week:
If the following image means anything to you, please checkout this [blog post](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/anatomy-of-a-program-in-memory/). Gustavo Duarte posted a great article about a program and how it "lives" in memory. I've been referencing the article since CS429!
